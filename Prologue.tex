\section*{Prologue}
Because I am bad at exam and failed.

\vspace{1cm}
You'll have to download the problems on your own. If you find an error, don't hesitate to pull an issue; if you want to collab, throw a PR. The proofs here are not the cleanest: they just work, and that's all I need.

Note that there are two different type of exams: Qualifying exams (held in November), and Entrance Exam(Held in February). There will be solutions to Qualifying exams, but not now.

Have fun suffering in test :) 

Best,
